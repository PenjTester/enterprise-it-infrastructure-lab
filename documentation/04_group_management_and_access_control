## 3. Creating and Assigning Security Groups

To implement group-based identity and access control, Global Security Groups (GG-) were created to logically organize users by department. These groups are the foundation for role-based access management and will be used later for resource access (file shares, permissions, and policy enforcement).

**Groups Created (Global Security Type):**

| Department | Group Name | Assigned User |
|------------|------------|---------------|
| Management | GG-Management | John Miller |
| HR | GG-HR | Sarah Davis |
| Sales | GG-Sales | Michael Lee |
| IT Support | GG-IT-Support | Emily Clark |

### Adding Users to Security Groups

Each user was added to their respective department security group using  
**Group Properties → Members → Add…**

> _(Note: All other users were assigned to their correct departmental groups using the same process.)_

### Group Membership Purpose

| Group Name | Role Purpose |
|------------|--------------|
| GG-Management | Administrative oversight, higher-level permissions |
| GG-HR | Sensitive employee records and HR-related access |
| GG-Sales | Client, CRM, and sales-specific resources |
| GG-IT-Support | Technical support responsibilities, IT tools, remote access |

These Global Security Groups will be used in future milestones to assign **permissions**, **folder access**, and **Group Policy Objects (GPO)** based on role-based access control (RBAC).
